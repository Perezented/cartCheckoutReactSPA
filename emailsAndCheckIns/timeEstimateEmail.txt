Dear {client's name},

Thank you for selecting our team to build out your online checkout portal. 
I'm pleased to provide an update for you on the front end.

The UI team has just handed us off the designs for both the checkout and cart screens. Doing just the cart and check out pages should be done within a couple of days, although hiccups may occur and I would prefer to have tests working and passing to be better safe than sorry. 
I would say to 3-4 days is a safe number of days to expect the checkout and cart fully functional, tested, and completed.
I will now get started on getting it connected to provide the information to the back-end servers and complete the checkout.
There are some aspects still missing from the designs, such as the PayPal payment section and mobile/tablet views. 
I could imagine the UI team having that ready by the time I have everything wired, but I cannot speak for their precise timeline.
I would suggest a "More Items to Consider" section on the checkout screen to potentially get that additional purchase from a customer. Possibly a "Recently Viewed" lineup as well.


Please let me know if there is anything else you may need or require and I would be happy to help.

Thank you,
Michael Perez
