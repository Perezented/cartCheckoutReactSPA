# cartCheckoutReactSPA

A React cart/checkout process. A cart component that updates the quantity of each item in the cart, as well as allows a user to remove an item from a cart. The checkout form takes a users address and credit card information and would forward it to a server, in this case displays a crude confirmation page.
